DMC Palette & Skein Tracker (Excel)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple colour palette and inventory tracker for DMC embroidery threads.
I made it because I got fed up with scribbling skein counts on random bits of paper and never knowing what I already owned. ðŸ˜…

What it does

Lists each colour with:

Brand

Code

Name

A colour swatch shown directly in Excel
Lets you enter how many skeins you currently have (including halves, like 1.5)
Automatically builds a shopping list of colours youâ€™re low on
Shopping list updates itself as you update your stash
Colour swatches stay visible in both lists (thanks to a tiny bit of VBA)
Requirements
Excel (Windows or Mac)
Enable macros (only used to paint the colour swatches)

How to Use

Open the workbook
Go to the Skeins column and enter what you have
Check the Shopping List sheet to see what youâ€™re running low on
Take the Shopping List sheet with you when you buy more threads ðŸ§µ


Notes

No external data sources

No internet required

All macros are visible & editable if you want to customise behaviour
